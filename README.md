## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sikares/PTT_HR-Chatbot.git
cd PTT_HR-Chatbot
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
# Or: source .venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (already present in this repo):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
HR_USERNAME=YOUR_HR_USERNAME
HR_PASSWORD_HASH=YOUR_BCRYPT_HASHED_PASSWORD <bcrypt hash>
```

- To generate a bcrypt hash for a new password, use Python:
  ```python
  import bcrypt
  print(bcrypt.hashpw(b"yourpassword", bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())
  ```

### 4. Start Qdrant Vector Database

You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.

```sh
cd qdrant
docker compose up -d
```

This will start Qdrant on `localhost:6333`.

### 5. Run the Chatbot

Back in the project root:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Login** with your HR credentials.
2. **Upload Excel files** (with required columns) via the sidebar.
3. **Process files** to clean and embed the data.
4. **Chat**: Ask questions about the feedback data in Thai or English.
5. **Manage chats and files**: Switch, delete, or create new chat sessions and manage uploaded files.

## Excel File Format

Your Excel files must contain the following columns:

- ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á Feedback
- BU
- ‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏ç./‡∏ö‡∏ó‡∏ç.
- ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏†‡∏ó Feedback
- ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏•‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏î Feedback
- ‡πÅ‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏î‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£
- ‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏á Process Owner
- Status
- ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏•‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏î Status

If any column is missing, the file will be rejected.

## Security

- **Authentication**: Only users with the correct username and bcrypt-hashed password (from `.env`) can access the app.
- **Data Privacy**: All uploaded files and vector data are stored locally. No data is sent to external servers except for LLM API calls.
- **Session Management**: Chat and file management is per user session.

---

## Customization

- **Prompt Template**: The prompt for the LLM is in `logic/qa_chain.py` and can be customized for your organization's needs.
- **Vector DB**: Qdrant settings can be changed in `core/vector_store.py`.
- **Authentication**: Usernames and password hashes are managed via `.env` and `config.yaml`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Qdrant not running**: Make sure Docker is running and `docker compose up -d` was successful.
- **OpenAI API errors**: Check your API key and usage limits.
- **File processing errors**: Ensure your Excel files have all required columns and are not corrupted.
- **Port conflicts**: Change the default ports in `docker-compose.yml` or Streamlit config if needed.
